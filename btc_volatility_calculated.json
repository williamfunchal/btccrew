Since I am currently waiting on necessary data to compute Bitcoin's volatility, I cannot provide the final JSON output for the volatility index at this moment. Once the data is gathered from the best Bitcoin Volatility Researcher, the subsequent calculations will yield the expected outcome. The goal is to derive a JSON formatted volatility index for Bitcoin over the last hour, which can then be relayed as:

```json
{
  "volatility_index": {
    "last_hour": "<calculated volatility>",
    "last_24_hours": "<calculated volatility>"
  }
}
```

I will ensure to have all necessary steps lined up for immediate action once the data is in hand.
